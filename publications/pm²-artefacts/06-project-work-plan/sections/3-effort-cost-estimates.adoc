== 3. EFFORT & COST ESTIMATES
This section documents the reasoning and final effort and cost estimates of all project activities. The work breakdown of Section 2 is the input for the estimation.

[aqua]#< Choose one or more of the different approaches to estimating: expert advice, historical information, similarity to other tasks, etc.#

[aqua]#For more accurate estimates, make sure you involve task owners or other experts for each impact area (usually members of the Project Core Team (PCT)). Include some contingencies based on the involved uncertainties or risks.#

[aqua]#Resources of different types can be necessary to accomplish certain tasks or deliverables: people, software, hardware, equipment, buildings & facilities, supplies, materials, etc.#

[aqua]#To calculate the Total Cost, you need to know the cost per unit for each resource.#

[aqua]#Make sure you include estimates of both internal and external resources>#

[aqua]#<Template for documenting of cost/effort breakdown. Make sure the identifiers are aligned with the Work Breakdown in section 2.>#

[aqua]#<For the documentation of your effort/cost estimation, you can use any template or representation that accommodates your project's needs and project/organisational requirements. >#

[aqua]#<We remind you that you are not obliged to use the templates provided here as examples. You can use your own template or scheduling software application and then simply copy & paste it  into this document, or simply reference the relevant file (offer a link or a folder/file location).>#

=== 3.2. Resource needs
[aqua]#<In this section a list of the necessary project resources can be added. A distinction shall be made between human and non-human resources.>#

[aqua]#< As an example, a project may need the following type of resources:#

* [aqua]#People#
* [aqua]#Software#
* [aqua]#Hardware#
* [aqua]#Equipment#
* [aqua]#Buildings & Facilities#
* [aqua]#Supplies#
* [aqua]#Materials#
