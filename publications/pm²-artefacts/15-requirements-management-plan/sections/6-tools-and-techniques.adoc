== 6. TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
The following techniques will be used for requirements management:

* [lime]#Interviews;#
* [lime]#Brainstorming;#
* [lime]#Workshops;#
* [lime]#Observation;#
* [lime]#Prototyping;#
* [lime]#MoSCoW prioritisation;#
* [lime]#…#

[aqua]#<Please list the requirement management techniques as per your project or/and organization needs. These can be used for requirements gathering, prioritisation and more.>#

The following tools will be used for requirements management:

* [lime]#Requirements documentation;#
* [lime]#Requirements traceability matrix;#
* [lime]#…#

[aqua]#<Please customize the above list as per your project or/and organization needs.>#

Requirements documentation and the traceability matrix may be part of a Requirements documentation and management system.

=== 6.1. Requirements documentation
The Requirement documentation may have the following structure:

[aqua]#<Define the documentation to be used for identifying, documenting, evaluating, prioritising, approving and validating requirements.>#
[cols="15s,90",options="header"]
|===
2+|Requirements documentation
2+h|Change Identification and Description
|ID|	The unique requirement identifier. It should be numbered sequentially.
|Name|	Short name of the requirement.
|Category|	Categorizes the requirement, e.g. Business need, Feature, Functional Requirements, Technical Requirements, Training Requirements, Quality Requirements, Performance Requirements, Security requirement, Support Requirements, Maintenance Requirements, System quality requirement, Business rule, etc.
|Type|	Requirement type refers to the technique used to describe the requirement, e.g.: Epic, User story, Story board, Use Case, User interface sketch, Business Process Model,  Report structure, etc.
|Requirement Description & Details|	A description of the requirement in text or using picturising techniques like use case diagrams, sketches, etc.
|Acceptance Criteria|	One or more acceptance criteria that allow the stakeholders to test if the deliverable meets the requirement.
|Status|	The status of a requirement can e.g. be any of the following:
Specified, Proposed, Approved, Incorporated, Implemented, Validated, For Fixing & Rejected.
|Requested by|	The source of the requirement. The stakeholder(s) to whom the requirement is important.
|Identification Date	The date that the requirements was brought up.

The above is a suggested list of attributes. No template is provided.

=== 6.2. Requirements traceability matrix
Requirements and requirement attributes may need to be traced from the high level business needs down to the detailed requirements, and finally into deliverables.

A traceability matrix is used to maintain these relations. This matrix can be an excel file with attributes as e.g. the one below, or a system, that may be part of a larger requirement management system

The Requirement traceability matrix may have the following structure:

[aqua]#<Define the Requirement traceability matrix to be used for tracking the relation between high level and detailed requirements and the deliverables.>#

[cols="25s,90",options="header"]
|===
2+^|Requirement traceability matrix
|ID|	Unique identifier.
|Name|	Short and descriptive name.
|Status|	The status of a requirement can e.g. be any of the following:
Specified, Proposed, Approved, Incorporated, Implemented, Validated, For Fixing & Rejected.
|Priority|	Statement of relative importance of the requirement, as e.g. High, Medium, Low, or Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have.
|Size|	An indication of the level of effort needed or how hard it will be to implement the requirement. (Big, Medium, Small)
|Comments|	Comments on the requirement. If the requirement has been REJECTED the reason for rejection must be described here.
|Derived From|	Identifier of the Requirement from what requirement it was derived (for example a Feature must be always derived from a high level Business requirement or Stakeholder Need, and a detailed requirement from a Feature).
|Related WBS code|	Identifier of the WBS element that produces the deliverable for which this is a requirement.
|Specification of documentation|	Name of the document where the requirement is specified and the file location.
|Test Plan|	Name of the document where the test plan or acceptance criteria for this requirement is described and the file location.
