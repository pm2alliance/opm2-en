== 2. REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES
Requirements Management is the process of gathering, documenting and validating requirements, and managing their implementation and change. It is a process that runs continuously throughout the project life cycle and relates to other project management processes, such as quality and change management.

The Requirements Management process can be tailored and customised to a projectâ€™s needs and can be documented either in a _Requirements Management Plan_ (this document) or in the _Project Handbook_. Separate requirements documentation is used to specify, categorise and prioritise the requirements and to provide traceability (requirements traceability matrix). These can be standalone documents or an annex to the _Project Charter_ or the _Project Work Plan_.

Note that managing changing requirements to configuration items (e.g. requirements documentation, the _Project Work Plan_ and deliverables) is part of project change management and is therefore documented in the Project Change Management Plan.
