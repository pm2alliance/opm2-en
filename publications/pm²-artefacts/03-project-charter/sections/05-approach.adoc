====	5.1 Methodology
[aqua]#<This section should mention the chosen project management methodology that the project will follow. In case that PM2 is not the chosen project management methodology, this section should describe the deviations to the standard/proposed project management methodology.
For the domain-specific work (e.g. information systems development), this section should also mention the chosen methodology or describe the deviations from the standard/proposed domain-specific methodologies (e.g. for information systems development, this section should describe the deviations from the standard and/or the proposed IT information systems development methodology).>#
