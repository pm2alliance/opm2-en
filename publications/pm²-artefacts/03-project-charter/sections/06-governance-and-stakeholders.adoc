==== 6.3 Other Stakeholders
[aqua]#<This section should identify all the stakeholders of the project and provide a brief profile description of the key stakeholders (and user groups) involved in the project, and the key problems that they perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their specific requests or requirements as these should be captured in a separate artefact, however, it provides the background and justification for why the requirements are needed.>#
