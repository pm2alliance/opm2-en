[aqua]#<Is there any impact in the “culture aspects” from this project?#

[aqua]#Analyse and evaluate the impact to the culture of the organisation.#

[aqua]#Generally, organizational culture cannot be described directly, but can be observed in the capabilities and behaviour of the organisations members, the controlling methods, the forms of communication, and so on. Consciously and subconsciously, they determine the behaviour of the project team members and give them orientation, and defines what is regarded as good, valuable and desirable.#

[aqua]#Look for a mission statement (old and/or new), the organisation of specific "social" events, etc. >#
