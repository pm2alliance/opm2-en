Any required change management efforts will be described as part of the implementation plan of the proposed solution.
Note: In the case that the project includes an Information System (IS), this section should also detail the current working environment of the target users. Provide this information from a non-technical / end-user perspective. Provide further relevant contextual information. Suggestions are:#

These interrelations and interdependencies can be found "inside" the organisation and "outside" of the organisation. This analysis is important as it places the current situation in the broader context of the organisation and the interrelations with other environments outside the organisation (e.g. external stakeholder groups).># +
