== 2.CHANGE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES
Project change management aims to bring transparency, accountability and traceability to all project changes implemented after the project scope and project plans have been baselined. It ensures that changes with a significant impact in any of the project dimensions (i.e. scope, time, cost, quality or risk) are properly assessed, agreed on and approved by the appropriate level of authority.

A project change can result e.g. from a scope change, a new requirement (quality,â€¦), an identified issue, a preventive action to reduce the risk level, or from a decision taken to change any of project baselines (scheduling, staffing or budget).

Note that managing changes to configuration items (e.g. project artefacts and deliverables) is part of quality management and are therefore documented in the _Quality Management Plan_.
