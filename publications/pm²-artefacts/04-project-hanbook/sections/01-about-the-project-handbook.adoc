=== 1. ABOUT THE PROJECT HANDBOOK
The Project Handbook documents the selected approach for implementing the project goals. It also highlights the key controlling processes to be used, the project policies and rules, and the overall management approach. [aqua]#<The project scope statement (from the Project Charter) is a key input for this document.>#
The Project Handbook is an important document since it defines the outputs of the planning (i.e. it defines the plans necessary for managing the project as well as to what extent they should be customize or/and tailored).
The Project Handbook becomes the basis for managing the project throughout its lifecycle and is an important point of reference for all project members and stakeholders. The Project Handbook is kept up to date throughout the life of the project. During the Closing Phase, the Project Handbook becomes an important point of reference for the Project-End Review Meeting, and should be properly closed and archived.
