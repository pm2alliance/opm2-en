# The Open PM² Project Management Methodology - English

The goal of this repository is to preserve a copy of the English Open PM² guide and related publications/works in an open format that allows easy follow-up of the publication's evolution. 

It is based on the original version of the guide and related works produced and published by the European Commission, DIGIT Centre of Excellence in Project Management (COEPM²), without modifications other than the format change. This repository aims to act as an enabler for community collaboration and revision.

The repository makes use of the AsciiDoc format for the publication texts. The AsciiDoc format is a useful presentation format in its own right: AsciiDoc markup is simple, intuitive and as such is easily proofed and edited. You can learn more about it in the [AsciiDoc quick reference](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/).

This repository contains the English version of the works. The translations are managed in a decentralized way. Each translation is kept in its own repository.
